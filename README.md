#This project is a WIP.

##Requirements:
1. Node.js installed on the host server.
2. CouchDB installed on the server and running on the default port: 5984

If you wish to recieve dynamic updates from Marvel you will need to sign up for your own API key.

This will eventually be configurable.

##Setup:
1. run ```npm i``` to install all node packages the project requires.
2. ```npm start``` will start the node.js server and the client.

The client can be accessed at localhost:3000
The server can be found at localhost:3001 

##To Do:
Have the server initialize the CouchDB with the databases, and views.
